+ Key in react: 
	- in react docs: Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed.
	 Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity.
	- in udemy: But basically what it does is it has something called a virtual dom where it compares what it would render
	now if it were to call the render method now or if it did actually adjust the real dom with the result
	of the render method to the previous dom it rendered. It does this compression of the future with the past basically.
	Chú ý: (in list) If the list changes, every element will receive a new index at least every element after the change. So index is not a good key.
